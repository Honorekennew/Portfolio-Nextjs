                    As a student at HETIC pursuing a Masterâ€™s in CTO and Tech Lead, I am part of a program strongly focused on
                    project-based learning. I am passionate about frontend mobile development and designing with Figma.
                    With solid experience in the JavaScript ecosystem and React technologies in particular, I am familiar
                    with agile methodologies and have a good command of backend technologies, DevOps tools and
                    practices, as well as SQL databases.

                        I design and optimize user interfaces for various learning
                        projects using React Native and Expo. I regularly create
                        web and mobile interfaces with Figma, which helps me
                        sharpen my design skills.
